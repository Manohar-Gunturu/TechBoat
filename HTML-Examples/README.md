<p>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the most basic building block of a webpage and used for creating and visually representing a webpage. It determines the content of a webpage, but not its functionality. </p>

<p>HTML adds "markup" to standard English text. Hyper Text&nbsp;refers to links that connect Web pages to one another, making the World Wide Web what it is today. By creating and uploading Web pages to the Internet, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web once your site is online. HTML supports visual images and other media as well. With the help of HTML everyone can make static as well as dynamic web sites. HTML is the language that describes the structure and the semantic content of a web document. Content within a web page is tagged with HTML elements such as <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head" title="The HTML <head> element provides general information (metadata) about the document, including its title and links to its&nbsp;scripts and style sheets."><code>&lt;head&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title" title="The HTML <title> element defines the title of the document, shown in a browser's title bar or on the page's tab. It can only contain text, and any contained tags are ignored."><code>&lt;title&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body" title="The HTML <body> Element represents the content of an HTML&nbsp;document. There can be only one <body> element in a document."><code>&lt;body&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article" title="The HTML <article> element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, an object,&nbsp;or any other independent item of content. Each <article> should be identified, typically by including a heading (<h1>-<h6> element) as a child of the <article> element."><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section" title="The HTML <section> element represents a generic section of a document, i.e., a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading. Each <section> should be identified, typically by including a heading (<h1>-<h6> element) as a child of the <section> element."><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p" title="The HTML <p> element (or HTML Paragraph Element) represents a paragraph of text."><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div" title="The HTML <div> element (or HTML Document Division Element) is the generic container for flow content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element (such as <article> or <nav>) is appropriate."><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span" title="The HTML <span> element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang."><code>&lt;span&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img" title="The HTML <img> element represents an image in the document."><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture" title="The HTML <picture> element is a container used to specify multiple <source> elements for a specific <img> contained in it. The browser will choose the most suitable source according to the current layout of the page (the constraints of the box the image will appear in) and the device it will be displayed on (e.g. a normal or hiDPI device.)"><code>&lt;picture&gt;</code></a>, and so forth. These elements form the building blocks of a website.</p>
